# limon

limon is a lightweight centralised logging and monitoring solution. It allows
you to easily collect and monitor logs from all your linux devices. It is not
designed for large organisations with complex networks, but for small orgs with
a few dozen servers and no time to setup a fully featured SIEM. It is probably
not an ideal solution but it you don't want a massive ELK stack running
somewhere, it is a
nice alternative.
